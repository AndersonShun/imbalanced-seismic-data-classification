- [MLP.py](https://github.com/danielgy/imbalanced-seismic-data-classification-/blob/master/MLP.py): Multilayer Perceptron model
- [classify_train.py](https://github.com/danielgy/imbalanced-seismic-data-classification-/blob/master/classify_train.py): train and test the classifer with the processed and filed data sets. For rebalance the training samples, [SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)](https://www.jair.org/media/953/live-953-2037-jair.pdf) was applied and 10-fold cross validation was used during the training 
period. 
- [CNN_series.py](https://github.com/danielgy/imbalanced-seismic-data-classification/blob/master/CNN_series.py):Convolutional Neural Networks as the classifer.
